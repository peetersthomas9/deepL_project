# deepL_project

These are the first two deep learning projects I have done. 

The goal of the first project is to implement a deep network such that, given as input a series of 2 ×14×14
tensor, corresponding to pairs of 14 × 14 grayscale images, it predicts for each pair if the first digit is
lesser or equal to the second.
THis project allow us to test different architecture and to observe the impact of different regularization method 
such as weight sharing, auxiliary loss, dropout and batchnormalization 

The goal of the second project is to design a simple neural network without using any pre-existing neural-network
python toolbox: only using pytorch’s tensor operations. This project allow us to understand how backpropagation works 
and to understand the basics of deep learning.
